# Introduction

Ganyu appears to us as an archer with a cryo vision. Her main job on the battlefield is to use her charged attack to hit enemies in a radius, but she is also a great support providing great value for any team composition.

# Talents upgrade priority

Normal Attack: Liutian Archery > Celestial Shower > Trail of the Qilin

For the main Ganyu gamestyle, leveling auto-attack is the highest priority, as this talent also improves the damage of Charged Attack of the first and second levels. Celestial Shower is next in priority, as it provides a huge amount of damage for the duration of its use. Trail of the Qilin is last in the upgrade priority as it provides the least amount of damage compared to other talents, but is also worth upgrading.

**Liutian Archery**

Liutian Archery is the basis of Ganyu. Ganyu's normal attack is quite weak, but her main specialization is her charged attack mechanic. While holding a charged attack, Ganyu reaches the first level of a charged attack that deals cryo damage. But if you hold the attack even longer, then Ganyu reaches the second level of a charged attack, first dealing damage to 1 specialized target, from which a charged attack comes out that deals damage to everyone in a radius, which is the main damage of Ganyu

**Trail of the Qilin**

Ganyu's elemental skill. No matter how useless this talent may seem at first view, Ganyu's elemental skill has a number of advantages. Using this skill, it does backwards dash ,leaving behind an Ice Lotus, which will attract all enemies (not counting bosses), and after the Ice Lotus is destroyed (depends on Ganyu's Max HP) it will deal Cryo damage in an area). This ability has quite a lot of damage at high levels of the talent.

**Celestial Shower**

Ganyu's elemental burst. This talent is a strong ability with a medium energy cost (60 energy). The sky rain creates a circle with a radius of 10 meters around Gan Yu, in which 50 icicles will fall in total in 15 seconds. The advantage of these icicles is that you are guaranteed to deal damage to a single target at least 10 times. And with 5 enemies, all 50 icicles are guaranteed. Each icicle has a 2.5m hitbox, which is incredibly useful in the Abyss. This talent is very strong in a team based on the Freeze reaction.


# Constellation 

## 1) Dew-Drinker

Taking DMG from a Charge Level 2 Frostflake Arrow or Frostflake Arrow Bloom decreases opponents' **Cryo RES** by 15% for 6s.  
A hit regenerates 2 Energy for Ganyu. This effect can only occur once per Charge Level 2 Frostflake Arrow, regardless if Frostflake Arrow itself or its Bloom hit the target.

The first constellation of Ganyu is one of its key constellations. Its buff can be compared to VV (Viridescent Venerer) but is much easier to apply and use. (Information taken from KeqingMains)

## 2) The Auspicious

Trail of the Qilin gets additional 1 charge

## 3) Cloud-Strider

Increases the Level of Celestial Shower by 3.Maximum upgrade level is 15.

## 4) Westward Sojourn

Opponents standing within the AoE of Celestial Shower take increased DMG. This effect strengthens over time.  
Increased DMG taken begins at 5% and increases by 5% every 3s, up to a maximum of 25%.  
The effect lingers for 3s after the opponent leaves the AoE.

It is a strong constellation, since with an endless cycle of use, the damage of Celestial Shower will increase, but it also has its own limit - for 15 seconds without continuing the cycle, it will reload.

## 5) The Merciful

Increases the Level of Trail of the Qilin by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15.

## 6) The clement

Using Trail of the Qilin causes the next Frostflake Arrow shot within 30s to not require charging.

This constellation is the strongest in Ganyu. With certain composition (especially those based on the Melt reaction), using two instantly charged attacks of the second level increases the damage for the entire rotation by dozens of times.

# Weapons

Ganyu signature weapon is the bow of Amos, as the passive ability of this bow increases the damage of Gan Yu's charged attack.

But besides these bows, there are plenty of options that suit Ganyu.

1) Amos bow

2) Aqua Simulacrum

# Teams for ganyu
The teams you will use depend on what kind of reaction you will play with Ganyu - freeze or melt.

With the "melt" reaction, Xiangling, Bennet are often used, and the fourth slot you can use a healer or a shield, the recommended Zhongli / Diona options.

**Artifacts** worth using in Gan Yu's melting reaction team:

1) Shimenawa’s Reminiscence (4) - is the best option in terms of final damage, but the rotation will be quite difficult due to the passive ability of the set.
2) Wanderer’s Troupe (4) - Considered the basic and best option, as it increases the damage of Ganyu's charged attack by 35%, and also gains 80 elemental mastery.

It's important to have 200 Energy Recovery for Xiangling and Bennet so they can use Elemental Burst instantly after their cooldown.

Another variant of the team is the Sunfire commands, based on an anemo that inflates the pyro effect. Characters such as Kazuha and Jean are the basis of such teams. The team consists of Ganyu, Kazuha, Bennet, and the fourth slot can be Zhongli. The rotation of such a team is very simple - use the elemental burst of Bennet, use the elemental burst of Kazuha, and every second the Pyro effect will be applied to the character, which makes the gameplay very simple.

One of the important advantages of Jean is that her elemental explosion works perfectly with Bennet's elemental explosion, and the pyro effect will always be applied, without interruption, until the end of the elemental explosion, which is quite useful for the Ganyu's C6

The following commands are played through the freeze reaction

**Artifacts** that should be used in a team with a freeze reaction under Gan Yu:

1) Blizzard Strayer (4) - 15% bonus cryo damage + 20% crit chance when hitting enemy with cryo status, + also 20% crit chance on frozen opponents, is a strong option for Ganyu

Standard team with freeze reaction, based on the use of Ganyu, hydro character, anemo character, cryo character. A good hydro character under Ganyu is Mona or Xingqiu (but he has his own nuances). The best variants of anemo characters under Ganyu are Venti or Kazuha. Their ability to pull opponents and use the "Swirl" reaction

One of the famous teams is "Morgana" using Ganyu, Mona, Venti and Diona. The rotation is quite simple: using Ganyu's elemental blast, using Venty's elemental burstand its elemental skill, using Mona's elemental burst and her elemental skill, and using Ganyu's second level charged attacks. Pros of using this rotation: increasing Mona's elemental burst buff for Ganyu. Diona is used to gain energy and heal.
